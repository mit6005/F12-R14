/**
 * Exercises for the first 6.005 Recitation on Scala.
 * Jean Yang (jeanyang [at] mit)
 * November 2012
 *
 * Things we will do in recitation:
 * - Get everyone running Scala.  See:
 *   https://sites.google.com/site/jeevesprogramming/tutorial/introduction-to-scala-for-6-005
 * - Section 1: Recursion (ex. 1) and tail recursion (ex. 2).
 * - Section 2: Map (ex. 3), filter (ex. 4), and reduce (ex. 5, 6).  How reduce
 *   is all you need in life (ex. 7, 8).

  /* From Martin Odersky's Scala by Example:
     A common way to compute square roots is by Newtonâ€™s method of successive
     approximations. One starts with an initial guess y (say: y = 1).  One then
     repeatedly improves the current guess y by taking the average of y and
     x/y. As an example, the next three columns indicate the guess y, the
     quotient x/y, and their average for the first approximations of 2.
     1        2/1 = 2             1.5
     1.5      2/1.5 = 1.3333      1.4167
     1.4167   2/1.4167 = 1.4118   1.412
     1.4142   ...                 ...
     y        x/y                 (y + x/y)/2
